# eng4d10FitActivity
- Fitness plays an important role in my life, as my coach usually said, "What you need to do to prevent and reverse chronic disease is off the carbs and off the couch." My coach is a young man who acomplished at leat 3 rounds of 15 deadlifts, 10 dumbbell cleans, and 10 bar facing burpees everyday.
- I am , of course, not as good as he did, but i have my own trick to kip fit, the apps. I use two apps to monitor the diet and the exercise. First One  is MyFitnessPal. This free app lets me count the calories that i consume everyday as well as tally up the calories i expend, and then see if they balance. It's really helpful, especillay when i going out to have dinner with my friend.
- Another app I love is The Johnson & Johnson 7 Minute Workout because it helps me get some amount of exercise in a very short amount of time. Unlike other seven-minute workout apps, this one adjusts its level of difficulty based on me current fitness level. So i won't be weared out by too much workout.
