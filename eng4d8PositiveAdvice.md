# eng4d8PositiveAdvice

The most positive advice I have ever got is from a game developer who taught me to make website. He said that to get more productive hours is much more valuable than to count how many code I have write.
In order to be productive, he asked me to imagine living in a framework which is built from three tiers: the environment, the body and the mind. You need to prepare each element before starting to work. A well-maintained body can't do much in a distraction-polluted environment, and a trained mind won't help an exhausted body. 
- environment
  + Since our levels of willpower, motivation and self-awareness are not constant, a properly organized environment is like setting a safeguard in advice which is essential to overcome the low points.
- body
  + There's no virtue in wearring out the body for the sake of some shortterm deadlines. Lack of sleep, physical inactivity, junk food and caffeinated beverages are the signs of a workflow failure. It's perfectly fine with eight hours sleep a day. Sleep is the fuel for feeling and thinking better.
- Mind
  + We are shaped by our habits. The healthy environment and body tiers create comfortable conditions for strengthen our minds. The most useful and simple way is to watching the mind regularly and find out the recurrent patterns. Learning something irrelevant can improve the state of mind too.
