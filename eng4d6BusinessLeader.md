#eng4d6BusinessLeader
- One of my favourite business leader is no doubt Vitor Fuch, the president of a american medical information company.
- He collected the medical cost data from 1950 to 1965 and founded that during that period of time, per capita expenditures of community hospiptals grew fairly steadily at a rate of about 8 percent annually, while the economy for the same period was only 5 percent annually. He was not happy with the booming hospital costs and questioned if the physicians and hospital administrators truly serving the social interest. Therefore he decided to build the most successful medical information media,Uptodate, to serve the public at more reasonable cost and less expenditure. Everybody could share the knowledge of majority disease and get to know which treatment they can choose.
- I think he is a wonderful leader finacially and intellectually because he impoves the situation of getting professional medical advice from solid source efficently at a goood price. He provides a good product.
