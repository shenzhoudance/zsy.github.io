# eng4d9ImportantLetter

- The most important letter I've ever got is from the project manager who I work with during the summer internship. I was tortured by a enormous file composing and everyone was too busy to instruct me since the company just got a big case. I have no idea what to fill in and the deadline was a week later. So I wrote an email to my manager and asked her for help. She replied two days later after when I was almost devastated and about to quit the job.
- In the letter, she said, it is your responsibility to fail meeting the goals, you are the person who is ultimately responsible for the success of failure of your job whether you are a senior stuff or a internship student. You can't wait around until somebody tells you what to do. If you're unclear about a directive coming down from senior leadership, you can't waiting for them to clarity it. The value you create will be largely manifest in the work of your team. Don't let the insecuity and self hesistation turn you into a bad employee.
- And after that, i just pumped up and finish all the process that need to be done. At the last day, I finally brought the qualified file to my manager. It taught me that we can acheive the goals only by our own hand and never counting on others.
