  + Getting the first python program was the toughtest and most rewarding thing I've done. It can input my time data and output a pie graph which demonstrate how I spent the day. It is powered by data analysis application, pandas, and import a visualization module called matplotlib, which is pretty poplular in data science nowadays.
  + But a year ago I knew almost nothing about coding. Getting the program from a nontraditional backgroud is a long way and here's how I did it. I joined a online programming bootcamp to accomplish the task they give me such as writting little game with the help of the textbook. But soon I realized that I wanted a real-world program. So I fished the task as soon as possible and enrolled in another self-study coding online community where we are allowed to release ourown project and get tech support from the coach. Without textbook, it was so hard to make coding right and stuck in tiny mistake of numerours variables. Coding is efficienct but complicated. Having a support system who always be there can do it is immensely helpful.
  + After three months, i managed to have the first application for myself. It waw the most wonderful achievement I've ever made.
