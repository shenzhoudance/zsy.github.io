Morning! I am here to write a report of my feelings to start a day. 
> Report is always good!

It has been much of an emotional turmoil yesterday where I found my leadership in jeopardy. 
> God, I am not a fan of leadership. I am a fan of **抱大腿ship**. But I will try to understand your situation and see what Miao Sir can do for you.

It is still to my concept that ugly faces are less likely to receive respect, or in other words, need to work much harder for respect. 
> It's true that people with *ugly faces* usually need to work much harder for respect. But **poor people, short people, gay people, people with unique personality** also find theirselves in a difficult situation. And as your commander(I am the leader of MiaoWang World), I think what makes your life tough is not about your faces but your **personality**.

I feel frustrated. 
> That's good! Frustration teaches you **humility**, which is pretty rare in people with penis. 

I dont like the fact that takka was invited by someone else to yip sir's class, while when i tried to reach a friendly hand to jack by telling him yip sir's class, to my astonishment, jack did not reply me. 
> Seriously, Takka, this name is like a whore name. Why are you even care about a man with such shit name??? And jack is diagnosed with **Dyslexia**, which means that he just can't understand other people's message and enjoy pretending he is invisible. These two people are disabled people, one is disabled by his brain, and the other is a blind people. So, just **ignore** them.
> 在本喵🐱众多能力中，本喵🐱最得意之一的能力就是，**选择性忽略**。 It is really great, it makes you feel it is you are controlling the world not others. But is 收费项目。 So you know, you need 马🐴泥才能体验。

I am aware of the jeopardizing effect to mix interpersonal troubles in time-rushing studying. 
> 第一，你这句语法不同哈，应该是 "I am aware of sb doing sth".
> And, life is born to mess up. It's good thing that you have something to bother. The uncomfordable feelings will prepare you adapt to 职场政治。Your problem is not about **dealing with interpersonal troubles**, your problem is **handle the feelings of fear, uncomfordable and disgust**. 
> **本喵🐱总觉得你可能想错方向了。** 人际困难永远是难以解决的，就像没钱一样；但是处理好自己的情绪，这个可能解决的。你好像没有在 情绪方向有所努力，而在人际关系方向上投入太多。边际效应递减，如果一个方向努力投入过多，它就会变得越来越缺少价值。所以本喵🐱建议你，要在控制情绪方向有所努力。

But I am hopeless to see myself being an interpersonal relationship underdog since gekko. 
> Hopeless is good!! 绝望教我成长。这可以让你明白，哪些领域你不必再费力了，而去寻找真正属于你的领域。

I hope by writing reviews and diary can make myself feel better. 
> Diary is really helped. Especially writing to the allmighty, 喵本喵神🐱。

Guess i was really wrecked in my childhood xd. 
> Relax, i am wrecked too! Dont's worry about that, wreck is our middle name!

thank you zhang dada for reading my diary!! salanghe!!
> Go to study massage Class ASAP!!!

Your allmighty Miao🐱
KISS KISS!!!
