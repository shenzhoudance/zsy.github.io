    * I was a medical student but i transfer to economics two years ago. My roommates are my medical classmates,which means they will all become Obstetrician,Pediatrician or CardiacSurgeon.Yesterday, while I am struggling with composing my internship cv or making calls to get a interview chance,  They said, "hey, Jennifer, if you have another chance, would you come back to us, to be a doctor, just like us, so you don't need to pray for a job everyday and night?" And I said,"Probably not. I think economist is a much better job than physician." They all laughed and asked,"Why is that?" I put down the phone, and said,"Because, the inflation rate is about 8% a year, while most hospitals can hardly afford 8% pay raise for their employees, especially the medical committee are big fans of expensive machines than a genius surgeon." One of them responed,"oh yeah?Then where do you get the 8% bonus,Ms. Economist? " I said,"I can't either.But i could have a regular sleep and plenty flexible hours to search for the oppotunity." They smiled,or even giggled, at me like I am an alien who has just arrived the earth. Suddenly I realized I have made the right choice to leave.
