sth I bought that made me happy

I use to buy things that can make me happy, till recently someone told me that I should buy time, not stuff, might make me more happier. I work in a law firm and usuall find myself squeezed for time. I enjoy the luxury of paying someone else to cook while i am allowed to do something of much more value than buying a fancy pair of shoes. With delicious supper, i would save nearly one hour and prepare more for the annual meeting. Buying time-saving services makes me feel less stress and get more chance to have fun in life.
